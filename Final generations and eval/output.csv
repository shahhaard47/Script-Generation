 The man takes a deep breath, turns the gun, and BOOM!

 A whistle blows nearby. Roger calmly raises his gun, and fires two
 shots into the back of the dog. The fallen dog jumps up and over
 the slab, snarling through the windshield. Roger charges out of the
 compound, firing shot after shot at the dog as it flies out of the
 compound.
 
 The remaining dog lands on Roger's windshield, then gets up and
 runs over to the first compound.

 We see the Isengardtred truck, then the Wellhead, followed by the
